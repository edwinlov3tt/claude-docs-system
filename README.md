# Claude Docs System

Automated documentation and project management for Claude Code projects. 8 commands. Drop into any project.

**Philosophy**: You code, Claude documents. Run `/sync` at the end of sessions. That's it.

---

## Quick Start

**Install into a new project:**

```
Install the documentation system from https://github.com/edwinlov3tt/claude-docs-system — copy commands to .claude/commands/, copy templates to .claude/docs/ and .claude/features/ and .claude/tasks/ (don't overwrite existing files), merge CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md into my CLAUDE.md, then run /audit to populate documentation from my codebase.
```

**Update an existing installation:**

```
Update my claude-docs-system from https://github.com/edwinlov3tt/claude-docs-system — overwrite all files in .claude/commands/ with the latest, copy any new templates without overwriting existing docs, and check CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md for any new sections to add to CLAUDE.md.
```

## Commands

8 commands. That's all you need.

| Command | When | What It Does |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/onboard` | New Claude instance | Read all docs, generate project briefing |
| `/dev` | Ready to code | Check environment, install deps, start servers |
| `/sync` | End of session | Auto-extract issues, decisions, services from conversation |
| `/push` | Ready to ship | Scan for secrets → review changes → commit → push |
| `/feature` | Have an idea | Log it with phase/complexity/value assessment |
| `/task` | Ready to build | Create, view, or complete implementation tasks |
| `/audit` | Need status check | Deep code scan, production readiness, find undocumented items |
| `/handoff` | Sharing project | Generate comprehensive developer handoff doc |

---

## Workflows

### Starting a New Session

```bash
/onboard                  # Get briefed on project state
/dev                      # Start the servers
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Code normally with Claude...
# Discuss bugs, make decisions, integrate services...
# At the end:
/sync                     # Claude extracts everything into docs
```

### Logging Ideas

```bash
/feature add OAuth login with Google    # Logs idea + assessment
/feature                                # View backlog by phase
/feature mvp                            # View only MVP features
```

### Building Features

```bash
/task                           # View task board + parallel groups
/task add-oauth-login           # Create detailed implementation task
# ... implement following the steps ...
/task done add-oauth-login      # Verify + archive when complete
```

### Multi-Instance Development

```bash
/task                     # Check "Parallel Execution Groups"
# Instance A: picks task from Group A (modifies src/components/)
# Instance B: picks task from Group B (modifies src/api/)
# ❌ Never run tasks that modify the same files
```

### Shipping

```bash
/push                     # Scans secrets → shows changes → commits → pushes
                          # Blocks if secrets found, logs to KNOWN_ISSUES.md
```

### Weekly Checkup

```bash
/audit                    # Full scan: readiness, undocumented items, issues
```

### Before Handoff

```bash
/audit                    # Ensure docs are current
/handoff                  # Generate HANDOFF.md
```

## What `/sync` Extracts

| If you discussed... | It goes to... |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Bugs, errors, "this doesn't work" | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| "Let's use X because Y" | `DECISIONS.md` |
| `npm install stripe`, API keys | `services/stripe.md` |
| New routes, components, modules | `components/*.md` |
| What was built/fixed this session | `CHANGELOG.md` |

## The Feature → Task Pipeline

```
/feature "add export to CSV"
    ↓
Assessed: Phase v1.0 | Complexity S | Value Medium
Saved to .claude/features/add-export-csv.md
    ↓
When ready to build:
    ↓
/task add-export-csv
    ↓
Creates detailed task with steps, deps, parallel safety
Saved to .claude/tasks/add-export-csv.md
    ↓
Implement following the steps...
    ↓
/task done add-export-csv
    ↓
Verified, archived, dependent tasks unblocked
```

## Installation

### Method 1: Claude Code (Recommended)

Tell Claude Code:

```
Install the documentation system from https://github.com/edwinlov3tt/claude-docs-system into this project
```

Claude will clone, copy commands and templates, merge CLAUDE.md, and run initial audit.

### Method 2: Manual

```bash
cd your-project

git clone https://github.com/edwinlov3tt/claude-docs-system /tmp/claude-docs

# Commands
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp /tmp/claude-docs/commands/*.md .claude/commands/

# Doc templates
mkdir -p .claude/docs/services .claude/docs/components
cp /tmp/claude-docs/docs-templates/*.md .claude/docs/

# Task templates
mkdir -p .claude/tasks/archive
cp /tmp/claude-docs/docs-templates/tasks/*.md .claude/tasks/

# Feature templates
mkdir -p .claude/features/archive
cp /tmp/claude-docs/docs-templates/features/*.md .claude/features/

# CLAUDE.md protocol
cat /tmp/claude-docs/CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md >> CLAUDE.md

rm -rf /tmp/claude-docs
```

Then in Claude Code: `/audit`

## Best Practices

1. **`/sync` at the end of every session** — This is the main habit
2. **`/feature` when you have ideas** — Capture them before you forget
3. **`/task` before building** — Break work into parallel-safe chunks
4. **`/push` instead of raw git** — Never accidentally push secrets
5. **`/audit` periodically** — Weekly or after major changes
